#do we understand git now?
# I really hope so
# I am pretty sure that I am getting it, New changes are marked green in the 
# buffer zone, and then you can add them to the staging area, and then commit
# and it seems that there is an indexed version of the code with essentially acts
# as a checkpoint, and then you can push the code to the master branch
